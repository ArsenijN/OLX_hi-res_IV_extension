[Extension avaliable for `Firefox` only](https://addons.mozilla.org/uk/firefox/addon/olx_hi-res_iv/) for now

# Why
Because I spend a lot of time on OLX, searching the HDDs at reasonable price, I regularly open the images to look up for details, like if drive was tampered with, or if it have some other issues - a lot of things that need the "zooming" on image, that... wasn't avaliable when image was small.

Because of optimizations and... **a lot of other reasons** (like bandwidth optmization), OLX limits the resolution, and due to how backend and frontend works - OLX front page uses resolution value in link that **didn't correspond to the image's native one**, and server converts it on demand. It's like if you have one original image with 1920x1080 resolution and on-demand code that converts the image to other format with, let's say, 1366x768 when link provide that info. So OLX do that exactly.

So, opening images in new tab and set the image resolution to 10000 by 7000 resolve all the problems that I listed, and this is why I created `OLX hi-res IV`


# Possible issues?
Idk if OLX Group would allow that thing to exists because... it can create higher bandwidth usage, **but it was on demand**, not always, so... It's more like user experience improvement than OLX's problems because of higher server loads, bandwidth and etc. etc.

If for some reason OLX group would like to talk to me - I leaved my mail on [extention page](https://addons.mozilla.org/uk/firefox/addon/olx_hi-res_iv/)
