Extension avaliable only for `Firefox` for now

# Why
Because I spend a lot of time on OLX searching the HDDs at reasonable price, I regularly open the images to look up for details, like if drive was tampered with, or if it have some other issues, a lot of things that need the "zooming"

By some reason OLX decide to limit resolution (maybe to optimize the bandwidth), they limited it to value that didn't correspond to the image's native one

So, opening images in new tab and set the image resolution to 10000 by 7000 resolve all the problems that I listed
